1. If no exception occurs both statement 4 and 5 will be executed. Statement 5 will be because the program throws no exception thus it will follow the normal top down execution of statements. Statement 4 will execute because it is in the Finally clause and this clause will always execute no matter the place or if an exception is thrown.

2. If the exception is of type Exception1 both statement 4 and 5 will be executed. Statement 4 will execute because it is in the Finally clause and this clause will always execute no matter the place or if an exception is thrown. Statement 5 will execute because even though there is an exception it is handled and the flow of the program can continue normally after the catch.

3. If the exception is not of type Exception1 statement 4 will be executed. Statment 4 will execute because it is in the Finally clause and this clause will always execute no matter the place or if an exception is thrown. However, Statement 5 will not be executed as the flow of the program is stopped after the Finally clause as the exception is not handled.
